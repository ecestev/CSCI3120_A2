Different Sizes

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a series of HTTP requests in a random order where some of the requests are for the same file.


Expected Result: The printed sequence on the server side will be 

Request 6 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 8 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 1 Completed

On the client side, eight HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the file
that was requested.
