Title: RR - Performance Testing 2

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to categorize the response times for the RR method using the same .in file as 
for test4_2.in where a series of HTTP requests are all sent at the same time followed by a delay and another series 
send at the same time. The first batch of requests contains a large file so the purpose is to see how this impacts 
the average response time. 

Processing order will be random so we will deal with averages.


Expected Result: Average response time will be greatly reduced vs SJF method using this same .in file due to the elimination
of starvation.
