Title: RR - Repeated Series of Requests Separated by a few second time slice

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a series of HTTP requests in a random order where some of the requests are for the same file,
delays for a few seconds, and then sends another series of requests. This tests that the server
sleeps and wakes properly and that a previously processed queue has no impact on a new queue.


Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the end of the queue and processed from the 
beginning.

The printed sequence on the server side will be 

Request 6 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 8 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 1 Completed

Request 14 Completed
Request 11 Completed
Request 12 Completed
Request 13 Completed
Request 16 Completed
Request 10 Completed
Request 15 Completed
Request 9 Completed

On the client side, eight HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the files
that were requested. It will then display nothing for a few seconds until the next batch of
requests comes through at which point it will display another eight HTTP responses followed
by the files that were requested
