Title: RR File not Found

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a a series of HTTP requests where one request is for a filename that does not match
any files in the working directory.

Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. The request for
the file not found will not be assigned a sequence order or added to the queue, therefore 
the printed sequence on the server side will be 

Request 2 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 1 Completed

On the client side, six HTTP responses will be sent, the third being 'HTTP/1.1 404 File Not Found'
