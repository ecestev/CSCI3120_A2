Title: SJF - Requests for Same File Spread Randomly Throughout Series of Requests for Files of 
Different Sizes

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a series of HTTP requests in a random order where some of the requests are for the same file.


Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. Jobs will be sorted 
by size but where any jobs have the same size, they will be sorted by their sequence number.
Therefore files will be processed SJF where requests of identical filesize will be handled in
a FCFS manner.

The printed sequence on the server side will be 

Request 6 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 8 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 1 Completed

On the client side, eight HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the file
that was requested.
