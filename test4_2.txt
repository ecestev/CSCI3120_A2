Title: SJF - Performance Testing

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to categorize the response times for the SJF method where a series
of HTTP requests are all sent at the same time followed by a delay and another series send at the same time. 
The first batch of requests contains a large file so the purpose is to see how this impacts the average response time. 

Processing order will be random so we will deal with averages.


Expected Result: Average response time will be greatly increased as the second batch of jobs will exhibit starvation - 
waiting in the queue until the large (1GB) file requested in the first batch of requests is completed.
