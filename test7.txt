Title: RR - Requests for Same File Spread Randomly Throughout Series of Requests for Files of 
Different Sizes

Author: Stephen Sampson B00568374

Purpose: The purpose of this test is to see how the web server will react when the client
sends a series of HTTP requests in a random order where some of the requests are for the same file.


Expected Result: The web server should add all valid requests to the queue. Jobs will be added to the back
of the queue as they come in and processed 8KB at a time from the front of the queue. After each 8KB is sent
if more jobs are waiting to queue they will be added to the back of the queue as well. 

Given the mix of jobs, it is expected that jobs will finish in the same order as they did using the SJF algortihm.
It is becoming clear that this will typically be the case. We will see in test9 and test9_2 however that this is not 
always the case as RR avoids starvation unlike SJF. 

The printed sequence on the server side will be 

Request 6 Completed
Request 3 Completed
Request 4 Completed
Request 5 Completed
Request 8 Completed
Request 2 Completed
Request 7 Completed
Request 1 Completed

On the client side, eight HTTP responses will be sent 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK' followed by the file
that was requested.
