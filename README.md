The purpose of this assignment is to get you to implement some of the scheduling algorithms and
to manage client connections in manner very similar to how operating systems manage processes.
In this assignment you build upon Assignment 1, to create a Scheduling Web Server. You will:
1. Implement three schedulers for your web server that schedule the service of the requests.
2. Create a test suite for the scheduling web server, and
3. Answer a couple questions.
You have a choice. You can either use your code from Assignment 1 as the starting point, or you can
use the provided solution to Assignment 1. Regardless, you need to ensure that you have assn2
